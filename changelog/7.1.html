      <h3>EBA Command Center 7.1 Changelog</h3>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>EBA File Repair has been replaced with EBA Automatic Repair. You can run EBA Automatic Repair with the 'auto' command in EBA Recovery Mode and EBA StartFail Mode</li>
        <li>When an issue with the installation occurs during execution, EBA Command Center will crash, with an error message after Operation Completed.</li>
        <li>When an issue with the installation occurs before EBA Command Center starts, EBA Command Center will go into EBA StartFail Mode, where you can access EBA Recovery and Automatic Repair.</li>
        <li>Initial setup is now done after EBA Command Center installs, instead of before.</li>
        <li>When EBA Command Center encounters a Wscript error, you'll get an alert before Operation Completed, instead of auto-crashing EBA Command Center.</li>
      </ul>
