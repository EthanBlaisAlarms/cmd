    <title>Removal of EBA Keys</title>

    <h1>We are phasing out EBA Keys!</h1>
    <p>EBA Keys have been around since EBA Command Center 3, was changed in 5, removed in 7, and re-added in 7.3.</p>
    <h2>But now, we are removing them for good.</h2>
    <h3>And heres why...</h3>
    <p>EBA Command Center was originally designed to be a paid service, where users would buy EBA Keys. We failed to get a payment system, but we did NOT want to re-write the code responsible for the EBA Keys. We simply posted the activation code on the website.</p>
    <h3>Until EBA Keys were removed in EBA 7</h3>
    <p>They were then re-added in 7.3, and were used for their intended purpose. We still didnt have a payment system, users would contact us to purchase. We added Pro and Enterprise.</p>
    <h3>Looking back, that was a terrible idea.</h3>
    <p>Thats why we are removing EBA Keys entirly. The code responsible for EBA Keys will be removed from EBA Command Center in release 8.4.</p>
    <h4>We are deleting the codes from the server, and we'll no longer support EBA Keys.</h4>
    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <h3>I bought an EBA Key! Do I get a refund?</h3>
    <p>Don't worry, we'll email you will a full refund. You'll be able to continue using the keys until it is deleted from the server. Don't worry, we will not delete anything until we email everyone that has purchased.</p>
    <h3>What happens if I do not update to 8.4?</h3>
    <p>When the keys are deleted from the server, you'll be downgraded to EBA Basic. We recommend updating to 8.4 to ensure you can continue to use the latest features.</p>
    <h3>What happens to the features that required EBA Enterprise or Professional?</h3>
    <p>These features will be available to everyone in 8.4.</p>
    <h3>When will EBA 8.4 be released? When will the keys be deleted?</h3>
    <p>After we email everyone, 8.4 will be released (expected on 6/3). We'll delete the keys 7 days after the release of 8.4.</p>
    <h3>What else is new in 8.4?</h3>
    <p>Minor bug fixes (such as 'Sub checkWScript', which monitors the WScript, and notifies users of WScript Errors). We are also adding Custom Plugin support. This feature is in development, and will not be available in 8.4, even though plugin code exists in 8.4.</p>
    <h2>We hope this change works out, as we are now providing the paid sections of EBA Command Center for free.</h2>
